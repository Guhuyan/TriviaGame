## Notes

This is a Travia game that I created using jQuery and CSS Grid. I wanted to make a game that would help me learn more jQuery, and this was it. The design is fairly simple, but I like it. Adding the alert to tell the user if his/her answer was correct or incorrect was part of the project's requisite. Personally, I'd like to remove the alerts and just print out all the questions along with the user's answers in red or green color at the end of the quiz, but one of the project requirements is to alert the user with a prompt after each question has been answered.
