# TriviaGame

12/1/2019

This is a Travia game that I created using jQuery and CSS Grid. The user is given one minute and thirty seconds to answer each question. There are 18 questions in total. All the questions relate to jQuery. I wanted to make a game that would help me learn more jQuery, and this was it. The design is fairly simple, but I like it. Adding the alert to tell the user if his/her answer was correct or incorrect was part of the project's requisite. Personally, I'd like to remove alerts and just print out all the questions along with the user's answers in red or green color at the end of the quiz.
